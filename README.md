# Window Zen Mode README

> #### [market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Weykon.window-zen-mode) | [github repo](https://github.com/weykon/window-zen-mode.git)  

> I don't know the config exist before, it's the similar doing the same thing with setting <u>"zenMode.fullScreen": false</u> in setting.json.
> but two point as me prefer this extension:  
>> 1. the <font color="#6876fe">"source-windowed"</font> mode __still keep the minimap__ which did not hide,  
>>    and I prefer to hide it, if you are too, <font color="#4bb37d">**use this**</font> .
>> 2. the <font color="#6876fe">"source-windowed"</font> mode will __align the text at center__ and __add two vertical line__ contain the text block when keeping only one page.  
>>    I think this put a unnecessary thing in view,
>>    I prefer avoid it, if you are too,  <font color="#4bb37d">**use this**</font> .  

This extension can toggle zen mode at windowed.
## The first time to use: 

(I updated default keyborad binding.)
```txt
ctrl + opt + k (then) z   # win
cmd + opt + k (then) z    # mac
    
# (then) means: release all input then press z
```


## 🎉 Succeed!

> `Note`: if unvailed, maybe some conflict beteween other keybindings.
